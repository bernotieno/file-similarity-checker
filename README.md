## Features

- Compare code and text files for similarity using custom token-based algorithms.
- Detect similar or duplicate files in a directory.
- Supports multiple formats for output reports: `text`, `html`, and `pdf`.
- Lightweight and fast, built with Go.

```bash
./similaritychecker pdf
```

2. Plain text output (default format):

```bash
./similaritychecker text ~/projects/
```
3. Html output
```bash
./similaritychecker html ~/projects/
```
 * `N.B`: Open the file in the browser to properly view for the html format

### ðŸ“„ Output
The generated report will include:

* File pairs compared

* Similarity percentage

* Category (e.g. "High", "Moderate", "Low")
